> ApiWright is under active development. The request format is versioned and validated, but the desktop packages are not code-signed yet.

## Why ApiWright?

API test tools tend to turn a request into a document full of scripts, copied assertions, hidden state, and team-specific setup. ApiWright takes the opposite approach:

- **Install, create a project, start working.** Conventional folders and asset paths are generated automatically.
- **Your project is the source of truth.** Requests, environments, hooks, assertions, and metadata are ordinary reviewable files.
- **Reusable behavior stays reusable.** The catalog turns common assertions, extractors, generators, hooks, and mocks into typed references with forms—not pasted code.
- **The IDE and CI run the same core.** The native GUI and headless CLI are adapters around the same Rust execution engine.
- **OpenAPI is active tooling.** Browse operations, generate valid values, complete requests, validate responses, track coverage, and generate test suites.

## Jira integration

The biggest win for teams: ApiWright ties API tests to the tickets they belong to.
Attach a Jira link to any story folder or single test — children inherit it, so
one link at the story level covers every request underneath. Links stay visible
next to each node in the project tree, travel with exported bundles, and are
stored as plain `.forge-jira` files, so they are reviewable in every pull
request and never live in a proprietary workspace database.

It goes beyond links: connect ApiWright to Jira Cloud or Server (Settings → Jira)
and fetch ticket details — summary, status, assignee — straight into the
project tree, or post run summaries as ticket comments without leaving the
IDE.

Editing Jira links is a ApiWright Pro feature (existing links stay visible for
everyone); the free 60-day commercial trial includes it — see
[COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md](COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md).

Until signed builds are available, Windows SmartScreen and macOS Gatekeeper may show an unknown-publisher warning. Release assets include SHA-256 checksums.

### Build from source

Install the stable Rust toolchain, then run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/EricVogt93/apiwright.git
cd apiwright
cargo run --release -p forge-gui --bin forge-ide
```

Linux builds also need the native windowing headers:

```sh
sudo apt install cmake pkg-config libgl1-mesa-dev libwayland-dev \
  libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxkbcommon-dev libxrandr-dev
```

## The zero-config workflow

1. Start ApiWright.
2. Select **New Project** and choose a directory.
3. ApiWright creates the conventional project structure and opens the first request.
4. Add story folders and requests from the project tree.
5. Run, inspect, assert, and commit.

There are no separate save-path dialogs for every asset. Paths derive from the selected project node and asset kind.

```text
my-api/
├── project.json
├── requests/
│   └── checkout/
│       ├── create-order.request.json
│       ├── create-order.assertions.json
│       └── create-order.hooks.json
├── assets/
│   ├── assertions/
│   ├── extractors/
│   ├── generators/
│   ├── hooks/
│   └── mocks/
├── environments/
└── specs/
```

Assertions and hooks deliberately live beside a request instead of inside it. The request document remains focused on HTTP data; ApiWright loads the sidecars as one effective executable request.

## Request format v1

```json
{
  "$schema": "../../schemas/request-v1.schema.json",
  "formatVersion": 1,
  "kind": "request",
  "meta": {
    "id": "checkout.create-order",
    "name": "Create order"
  },
  "bindings": {
    "orderId": { "value": "" }
  },
  "request": {
    "method": "POST",
    "url": "${env.baseUrl}/orders/${bindings.orderId}",
    "headers": [
      { "name": "Content-Type", "value": "application/json" }
    ],
    "body": { "type": "json", "value": { "sku": "ABC-1" } }
  }
}
```

The schemas in [`schemas/`](schemas) define requests and sidecars. The complete design is documented in [Request Format v1](docs/architecture/request-format-v1.md).

## Documentation

The [ApiWright Wiki](docs/wiki/README.md) is the full product guide. It covers the zero-config workflow, project layout, request and sidecar formats, the catalog, OpenAPI tooling, authentication, the AI Advisor, generated suites, CLI/CI usage, and the hexagonal architecture. Use [Repository Guidelines](AGENTS.md) for contribution rules.

## One catalog, no assertion copy-paste

A catalog entry contains a title, description, intent, execution phase, typed parameters, defaults, and an example. Selecting **Status is**, entering `201`, and inserting it produces a stable reference:

```json
{
  "use": "builtin:assert-status@1",
  "with": { "expected": 201 },
  "enabled": true
}
```

Project-owned assets use the same UI. A JavaScript implementation such as `assets/assertions/customer-shape.js` can have a colocated `customer-shape.meta.json`; every request then references the same implementation while providing its own parameters. Bindings and parameter sources avoid hard-coding variable names between tests.

## OpenAPI, environments, and auth

- Put a spec below `specs/`, configure a project URL, or inherit an OpenAPI source from folder properties.
- Browse operations by method and request shape, generate valid parameter values, add operations to the current request, and see which endpoints are already covered.
- Assign environments at project, folder, or request level; children inherit unless they override.
- Mark an existing request as an auth provider or configure a provider preset. ApiWright tracks token lifetime and refreshes before a dependent request would outlive the remaining token window.
- Jira links and OpenAPI/environment properties inherit from folders to descendants, keeping story-level setup in one place.

### Generated OpenAPI suites

Select a project folder and open the tools on the right. ApiWright writes generated output below that folder and keeps hand-written files outside it untouched:

| Generator | Output | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Contract tests | `contract/` | Runnable requests plus status, content-type and response-schema assertion sidecars |
| API tests | `api/` | Complete operation requests, assertions and an ordered sequence |
| Load & performance | `performance/` | k6 operation data and smoke, load, stress, spike and soak profiles |

Generated folders carry a ApiWright manifest and can be regenerated. Existing folders without that manifest are never replaced. k6 runs only GET, HEAD and OPTIONS by default:

```sh
cd requests/checkout/performance
k6 run -e BASE_URL=https://api.example.com -e PROFILE=load k6.js
# Explicitly opt in only against disposable test data:
k6 run -e BASE_URL=https://staging.example.com -e INCLUDE_MUTATIONS=true k6.js
```

## CLI

The `forge` binary is suitable for local scripts and CI:

```sh
cargo run -p forge-cli -- validate requests/users/get.request.json --root .
cargo run -p forge-cli -- run-v1 requests/users/get.request.json --root .
cargo run -p forge-cli -- ci requests/checkout --root .
cargo run -p forge-cli -- ci --regression --root .
cargo run -p forge-cli -- run-sequence smoke.sequence.json --root .
cargo run -p forge-cli -- assets .
cargo run -p forge-cli -- export requests/users --format json -o users.forge.json
cargo run -p forge-cli -- export requests/users/get.request.json --format curl -o get-user.sh
cargo run -p forge-cli -- import users.forge.json requests
```

`apiwright ci` accepts absolute or project-relative request files and folders and always executes the resolved requests as independent tests in stable path order. Mark a request as **Regression test** in its Project-view Properties; `apiwright ci --regression --root .` then executes only those marked requests and returns CI-friendly exit codes (`0` passed, `1` assertion failure, `2` configuration or execution error). `run-v1` remains available for interactive single requests and explicit multi-file sequences.

ApiWright checks the latest published GitHub Release at startup. A newer version opens a changelog dialog where it can be downloaded or skipped; downloaded packages are SHA-256 verified before the platform update flow starts. The release workflow publishes updates from version tags matching the Cargo version, such as `v0.2.0`.

Legacy `forge.json` workspaces remain runnable through `apiwright run`, and `apiwright migrate` / `apiwright migrate-all` convert them without silently dropping unsupported fields.

## Architecture

```text
forge-gui ─┐
           ├──> forge-core ──> HTTP, storage, scripting, OpenAPI
forge-cli ─┘
```

- [`forge-core`](crates/forge-core) owns request models, validation, execution, reusable assets, import/export and history.
- [`forge-gui`](crates/forge-gui) is the native `egui` desktop adapter.
- [`forge-cli`](crates/forge-cli) is the headless automation adapter.

The GUI should not reimplement execution rules, and the CLI should not need GUI state. See [Repository Guidelines](AGENTS.md) before contributing.

The AI Advisor follows the same boundary: the GUI assembles a bounded, redacted context while `forge-core` remains the source of truth for request parsing, OpenAPI matching, assets and execution. Provider transport is isolated in `forge-gui/src/advisor.rs` and uses an OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint.

## Development

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --locked
cargo build --release --workspace
```

GitHub Actions runs those checks on pull requests and builds the Windows EXE, Linux AppImage, and macOS DMG on version tags. A tag must match the Cargo version, for example `v0.1.0`.

## Security and local state

- `.forge-local/`, `.forge/`, `.env.local`, and `*.secrets.json` are excluded from version control.
- Export bundles omit secrets and runtime state.
- Project JavaScript is disabled until explicitly allowed after review.
- The embedded JavaScript runtime has resource limits and no exposed filesystem, network, or process API; it is not presented as an adversarial security boundary.
