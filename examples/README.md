# Examples

## `demo-workspace/`

A complete ApiWright workspace that acts as an executable product tour. Open the
`demo-workspace` folder directly in the ApiWright IDE to explore modern request
documents, sidecars, reusable catalog assets, mocks, matrices, sequences,
project auth, OpenAPI and inherited project properties. The original HTTPBin
collection remains available as a legacy-format example.

```sh
apiwright run examples/demo-workspace --env httpbin
apiwright ci requests --root examples/demo-workspace \
  --env demo --mock --allow-project-code
```

What it contains:

- **`project.json`** — aliases, secret providers and automatic short-lived auth.
- **`requests/`** — OpenAPI-aligned requests with assertion/hook sidecars,
  regression tags, folder-level environment/OpenAPI/Jira inheritance, static
  and dynamic mocks, and a data-driven matrix.
- **`assets/`** — data plus typed custom assertions, extractors, generators and
  mocks shown in the catalog.
- **`demo.sequence.json`** — an ordered smoke journey.
- **`specs/petstore.json`** — completion, coverage and test-generator input.
- **`forge.json`** — the workspace marker (name `Demo`).
- **`environments/httpbin.env.json`** — one environment (`httpbin`) with a
  plain `baseUrl` variable and a *declared* secret, `apiToken` (no value is
  committed — see below).
- **`collections/httpbin/`** — a collection named `HTTPBin` with an explicit
  `order` array and three top-level requests plus a `status-codes` folder:
  - `get-json.request.json` — `GET /json`, asserts status, content type,
    a JSONPath and response time.
  - `post-echo.request.json` — `POST /post` with a JSON body containing the
    `{{$uuid}}` dynamic variable; asserts the echoed payload and extracts
    `$.json.id` into a runtime variable (`echoedId`) for use by later
    requests in the same run.
  - `auth-bearer.request.json` — `GET /bearer` using bearer auth sourced
    from the secret `{{apiToken}}` variable.
  - `status-codes/get-404.request.json` — `GET /status/404`, asserting a
    `404` response.

### Secrets

`apiToken` is declared in `httpbin.env.json` with `"secret": true` and no
value, as secrets are never committed. To run the `Auth Bearer` request,
create the gitignored sibling file `environments/httpbin.secrets.json`:

```json
{
  "apiToken": "any-non-empty-value"
}
```

(httpbin's `/bearer` endpoint accepts any non-empty bearer token.)
